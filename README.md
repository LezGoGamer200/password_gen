Hello! So this is a password generator, and can make a password as long as you want, with 93 different characters if you choose to use lower and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
I also added a little part at the bottom to let you know just how many different passwords you can get with your current options. 
I will let you know however, once you get a long enough password length, it just says that there are infinite possibilities.
Also, just to let you know, if you use one of these passwords, make sure to write it down or save it in a secure location for later use, as this generator will not save the passwords it makes.
Anyways, have fun!
